# IPA
IPA(Interaction-Preserving Abstraction) is a framework that leverages characteristics of TLA+ and enables practical and efficient compositional model checking for TLA+ specifications of distributed consensus protocols.

This repository shows our experiment of applying IPA to the famous consensus protocol Raft.





Readers may refer to **IPA_Case.pdf** for detailed explanation for abstraction of each module.
