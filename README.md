# IPA
IPA(Interaction-Preserving Abstraction) is a framework that leverages characteristics of TLA+ and enables practical and efficient compositional model checking for TLA+ specifications of distributed consensus protocols.

This repository shows our experiments of applying IPA to the famous consensus protocol Raft.

Readers can find detailed explanation for abstraction of each module in [Docs](https://github.com/AnonymousAccountForReview/IPA/tree/main/Docs) and formal specifications in [Specifications](https://github.com/AnonymousAccountForReview/IPA/tree/main/Specifications).
